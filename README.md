ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @orgsite
hello, introduce me, and I will tell you 
how I found myself in the world of the internet, 
because when I was little I really liked hackers
or illegal actions, but I knew that this was
detrimental, that's why I studied more technology 
so that I could learn to help, not for crime or 
criminal in the digital world, I am a computer and 
network engineer, I often use the Android, Linux, 
Windows, Debian, Arch Linux operating systems, maybe
that's all, thank you
